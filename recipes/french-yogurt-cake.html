            <h2>Steps</h2>
                <ol>
                    <li>Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
                        Grease an 8-1/2x4-1/2-inch loaf pan with butter.</li>
                    <li>Sift flour, baking powder, and salt together into a bowl.</li>
                    <li>Combine white sugar and lemon zest in a bowl.
                        Rub lemon zest into the sugar with your fingers until fragrant.</li>
                    <li>Combine eggs, yogurt, juice of 1 lemon, and vanilla extract
                        in a large bowl; beat with an electric mixture until blended.
                        Add flour mixture and sugar mixture; beat on low speed until
                        batter is just combined. Fold in olive oil gently using a spatula.</li>
                    <li>Pour batter into the prepared loaf pan.</li>
                    <li>Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted
                        into the center comes out clean, 40 to 50 minutes.
                        Let cool in the pan, at least 30 minutes. 
                        Run a knife around the edge of the pan to loosen;
                        invert onto a serving dish.</li>
                </ol>
