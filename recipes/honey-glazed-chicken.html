                    <li>2 tablespoons soy sauce</li>
                    <li>1/8 teaspoon red pepper flakes</li>
                    <li>1 1/2 tablespoons olive oil</li>

                </ul>
            <h2>Steps</h2>
                <ol>

                    <li>Whisk honey, soy sauce, and red pepper flakes in a bowl;
                         set aside.</li>
                    <li>Heat olive oil in a skillet over medium heat; 
                        cook and stir chicken in hot oil until lightly brown, 
                        about 5 minutes.</li>
                    <li>Pour honey mixture into the skillet; continue to cook and stir 
                        until chicken is no longer pink in the center and sauce
